# Data Extraction Using LLM and Advanced RAG Techniques
This repository contains code for building an information extraction tool utilizing Large Language Models (LLM) and advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques. The tool enables users to upload documents and pose questions based on the content of the document.

Features
Document Upload: Users can upload documents in various formats (e.g., PDF, DOCX).
Question-Answering: Utilizes NLP and ML algorithms to generate accurate responses to user queries based on the uploaded document.
Advanced RAG Techniques: Incorporates cutting-edge RAG techniques for enhanced information extraction and question-answering capabilities.
Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/dibyanshu12/pdf-extractor.git

Download pre-trained LLM and RAG models (if necessary).


Upload a document and ask questions based on the content of the document.
